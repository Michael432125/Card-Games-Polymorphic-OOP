# Card Games Polymorphic OOP

The purpose of this project was to design and implement generic playing cards and human-computer card games, while maintaining the principles of encapsulation, reusability and generality. The two games which have been implemented are the ”Guessing” game and a simplified rendition of the “Black Jack” game.
